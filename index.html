            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Liam. I am originally form South Africa but currently live in Riverton, Utah. I enjoy listening, singing and playing music. I've been working in web development for about a year now. I am taking this class to better develop my skills as a web developer. I'm 22 years old, I really enjoy singing and playing guitar. I recently downloaded the music software Logic Pro and am trying to familiarize myself with it. Right now making music is a hobby that I am choosing to dable in. My dream career would be making and producing songs!<br>
            Currently I spend most of my time working or studying. As I mentioned before, I have been working in web development for over a year now. A few years ago, my dad, my sister, and myself started a family business. We specialize in automating business processes for small businesses. Our team is still small but is steadily growing.<br>
            I initially started studying Business Management when I started school back up last year in April. This semester I wanted to make a change, so I switched to Software Development. So far I'm enjoying the change! The classes that I have taken have helped me understand a little bit more about the industry that I work in.<br>
            Lastly, I want to introduce my family. My dad, Andre, and my mom, Tracey, are also originally from South Africa. I have an older sister, Michaela, and a younger brother, Rogan. My youngest brother, Dallas, is a full blown American, having been born in Utah.
