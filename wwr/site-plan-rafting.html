        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the website is to make profit by showing potetial customers what the experience will be like and by leading them to a page where they can book a time to complete a white water rafting run.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Who are the target audience?
            Our target audience includes people of the age of 14 and up. Depending on the severity of the river, this may change. Ideally we are dealing with people between the age of 14 and 60. Our typical customer enjoys being outdoors and does not mind the posibility of getting wet. They enjoy thrills.
            What do they want?
            Our audience wants to be able to book a trip that will last several hours. The trip should provide a challenge but not be so difficult that it causes danger to those present. They want to be able to bond with family and friends as they travel down the river. They want a guide who will assist them.
            What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?
            They will expect to see information regarding the length of the river and the time it takes to go from start to finish. They will expect to see a place where they can book/purchase a date to raft down the river. They will expect to hear about other customer's experiences of using our services for white water rafting.
